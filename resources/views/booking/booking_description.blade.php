                        <li>the client can physically attend the appointment (eg, they don't live too far away)</li>
                        <li>if a criminal appointment: the client has the charge sheet and brief, unless exceptional circumstances apply (eg they have an intellectual disability). Refer to duty lawyer otherwise</li>
                        <li>the client is reminded to bring all relevant paperwork to the appointment.</li>
                    </ul>
