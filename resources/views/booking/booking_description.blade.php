                    <h4 class="bold">Direct bookings</h4>
                    <p>Allows direct bookings into a VLA appointment service.</p>
                    <p>Before making a direct booking, ensure the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the client can physically attend the appointment (eg, they don't live too far away)</li>
                        <li>if a criminal appointment: the client has the charge sheet and brief, unless exceptional circumstances apply (eg they have an intellectual disability). Refer to duty lawyer otherwise</li>
                        <li>the client is reminded to bring all relevant paperwork to the appointment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <p>These other forms send an e-referral to the office providing the service, replicating the functions of the Outlook e-referral templates. A copy is bcc'd to the LegalInfoCallBack mailbox.</p>
                    <h4 class="bold">Appointment request</h4>
                    <p>For VLA Practice matters. Use where direct bookings are unavailable, or if in doubt about the appropriateness of a direct booking.</p>
                    <h4 class="bold">For assessment</h4>
                    <p>For VLA Specialist matters, where the receiving office conducts full assessment of the client's matter.</p>
                    <h4 class="bold">Phone advice</h4>
                    <p>For VLA Practice matters. Use to request phone advice for the client.</p>
                    <h4 class="bold">Duty lawyer</h4>
                    <p>For VLA Practice matters. Use to send a memo to the duty lawyer.</p>
                    <p>For more information on when to use these e-referral templates, please see your Legal Help manual.</p>
